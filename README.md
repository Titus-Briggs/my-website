https://titus-briggs.github.io/my-website/

This site is a work in progress — a growing portfolio that documents my journey through sport science, data analysis, and technical development. It’s built with Hugo, styled using the FixIt theme, and currently hosted on GitHub Pages (with plans to self-host in the future).

As it evolves, this site will become a central hub for:

* Project Highlights
  - Biometric dashboards, Python-powered analysis, performance support tools, and data visualisations.

* Technical Learning
  - Progress through courses like CS50, Python experiments, GitHub workflows, and other data tools.

* Insights & Reflections
  - Writing on training environments, coaching systems, and the role of data in performance decision-making.

Built with curiosity. Updated regularly.
If you spot something broken — or brilliant — feel free to open an issue or reach out. I’m always open to feedback.
