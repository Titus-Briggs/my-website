**[titus-briggs.github.io/my-website](https://titus-briggs.github.io/my-website/)**

This site is a **work in progress** — a growing portfolio that documents my journey through sport science, data analysis, and technical development. It’s built using **Hugo**, styled with the **FixIt** theme, and currently hosted via **GitHub Pages** (with plans to self-host soon).

As the site evolves, it will feature:

### Project Highlights
- Biometric dashboards  
- Python-powered analysis tools  
- Performance support visualisations

---

### Technical Learning
- Currently: Working through *CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python* via edX  
- Building real-world projects with Python and GitHub  
- Exploring large-scale data handling and SQL

---

### Insights & Reflections
- Writing on training environments  
- Coaching systems  
- The role of data in decision-making

**Built with curiosity. Updated regularly.**  
If you spot something broken — or brilliant — feel free to open an issue or reach out.
