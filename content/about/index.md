# Who am I?

Hi, I’m **Titus Briggs** — a **Sport and Exercise Science** graduate from Nottingham Trent University with a passion for bridging the gap between human performance and data.

Before moving into performance analysis, I competed at an elite level myself, playing in the Harlequins Rugby Academy and the London Broncos Rugby League Academy. That experience instilled in me the discipline, resilience, and composure needed to perform under pressure. However, after a series of concussions — and with the disruption of COVID — I made the tough decision to step away from playing. It was a turning point that led me to explore performance from a new angle: through science, systems, and insight.

At university, I immersed myself in the core pillars of sport science:

* Physiology – understanding how the body responds to load and recovers from fatigue

* Biomechanics – analysing movement, technique, and mechanical efficiency

* Nutrition – fuelling performance, recovery, and long-term development

* Sport Psychology – mindset, motivation, and behavioural insight

* Injury & Illness Management – tracking health and reducing risk in performance settings

Alongside my academic journey, I’ve worked consistently at Halfords in the Cycle Department. After a short period with the company, I progressed from entry-level bike builds to becoming a qualified technician — taking on increasingly complex repairs and diagnostics across a wide range of bikes, from hybrids and e-bikes to high-performance models. My growing technical expertise, combined with a proactive mindset, saw me step into an interim management role for a year, where I was responsible for overseeing workshop operations, supporting colleagues, and ensuring high standards of service and efficiency. The experience not only sharpened my leadership and problem-solving skills, but also reinforced my commitment to reliability, quality, and continual growth. I returned to the technician role while completing my final year at university, and I continue to work there currently.

I’ve had the chance to apply my academic learning in high-performance environments — notably at Nova Centurion Swimming Club, where I supported Olympic trialists through video analysis, biometric tracking, hydration testing, and data-driven goal setting. Whether collecting data at dawn or reviewing poolside footage with athletes, I’m at my best when translating insight into action.

Currently, I’m further developing my technical skillset through Harvard’s CS50, with a focus on Python, data visualisation, and systems thinking. I’m also developing a growing interest in track cycling — particularly in how biomechanics and data analytics can inform equipment choices, performance profiling, and athlete development.

I’m drawn to roles where analytical thinking, human insight, and attention to detail come together — where small changes create big impact, and where data doesn’t just inform, but empowers.
