# Who am I?

Hi, I’m **Titus Briggs** — a **Sport and Exercise Science** graduate from Nottingham Trent University with a passion for bridging the gap between human performance and data.

Before shifting into performance analysis, I competed at an elite level myself, playing in the Harlequins Rugby Academy and the London Broncos Rugby League Academy. That experience instilled in me the discipline, resilience, and composure needed to perform under pressure. However, after a series of concussions — and with the disruption of COVID — I made the tough decision to step away from playing. It was a turning point that led me to explore performance from a new angle: through science, systems, and insight.

At university, I immersed myself in the core pillars of sport science:

* Physiology – understanding how the body responds to load and recovers from fatigue

* Biomechanics – analysing movement, technique, and mechanical efficiency

* Nutrition – fuelling performance, recovery, and long-term development

* Sport Psychology – mindset, motivation, and behavioural insight

* Injury & Illness Management – tracking health and reducing risk in performance settings

## Technical Experience

Alongside my studies, I’ve built a long-standing career at Halfords, where I began with basic bike builds and progressed to handling advanced diagnostics across everything from hybrids to high-performance e-bikes. I stayed the course through lockdowns as a key worker, and later took on an interim management role, overseeing workshop operations and mentoring colleagues.

Now, I’ve stepped into the Department Manager (Specialist) role — a natural progression that reflects my technical expertise, commitment to quality, and ability to lead with consistency. Whether solving problems on the shop floor or fine-tuning systems behind the scenes, I bring a methodical and customer-focused mindset to the role.

## Performance Environments

I've applied my academic knowledge in elite sport settings — most notably at Nova Centurion Swimming Club, where I supported Olympic trialists using video analysis, biometric tracking, hydration testing, and goal setting. Whether collecting data at dawn or breaking down footage poolside, I’m at my best when translating insight into action. See my post for more information.

## Where I'm Going

I’m currently expanding my technical skillset through Harvard’s CS50, with a focus on Python, data visualisation, and systems thinking. I’ve been exploring tools like Tableau and Catapult to turn raw performance data into actionable insight — whether visualising training load trends or mapping behavioural patterns across environments.

I’m drawn to roles where analytical thinking, human insight, and attention to detail come together — where data doesn’t just inform, but empowers.
