## Nova Centurion Swimming Club

During my time at the club, I worked closely with over 40 elite swimmers, independently managing all aspects of performance analysis. I was responsible for collecting and cleaning data from a variety of sources—including heart rate monitors, hydration tracking, and lap times. I then interpreted this data to help athletes and coaches identify areas for improvement.

A key part of my role involved poolside video analysis, using GoPros and iPads to capture swimmers during training. This allowed for quick, stroke-specific feedback—whether it was refining a freestyle entry or improving breaststroke timing. I regularly checked in with swimmers to discuss these clips and offer practical pointers they could apply immediately in the pool.

Using time-series data and performance trends, I helped coaches tailor training sessions more effectively. I also created visual dashboards and reports that supported evidence-based decision-making. One of the most rewarding aspects of the role was working directly with athletes in goal-setting sessions—translating complex data into clear, realistic performance targets.

Beyond analysis, I took on additional responsibilities such as liaising with companies like 1080 Motion to explore how their equipment could enhance our swimmers’ capabilities. I also supported club events, including swim meets, where I designed branded banners featuring sponsor and club logos. These were professionally printed and are still proudly displayed at the pool today.

I ensured all data was handled securely, following GDPR and safeguarding guidelines to protect athlete privacy. I regularly presented findings to senior coaching staff, contributing to broader discussions around athlete development and long-term planning.

## Reflections and Highlights

One standout moment was travelling with the team to Liverpool at the end of Cycle 2. Many swimmers achieved personal bests at that meet, which was a powerful validation of the work the coaches and I had done together.

I’m especially proud that eight of our swimmers qualified for the Olympic trials during my time at the club—an achievement that reflects the strength of the programme and the collaborative effort behind it.

This experience confirmed how much I enjoy combining data with human performance—not just analysing numbers, but using them to help people grow and reach their goals. It also pushed me to keep learning—whether that meant improving my data visualisation skills, diving deeper into biomechanics, or finding better ways to communicate insights to non-technical audiences.

## The Data

I collected all time data by hand as swimmers came into the wall—jotting down times while trying to remember who finished in which lane, often just seconds apart. It was definitely a shock in my first week; the pace was relentless, and there was no room for hesitation. But I quickly realised that staying organised, thinking ahead, and keeping calm under pressure were key to staying on top of it.

As the swimmers swam down, I’d transfer everything into Excel spreadsheets (like the one pictured above). I calculated the average split time for each set—both as a whole and in sections where applicable—then compared it to the previous week’s average and the swimmer’s cycle average. I’d write it all up on a whiteboard so swimmers could visually track their progress week by week, which became a powerful motivator during tough training blocks.

If time allowed during the session, I also created dashboards to visualise trends and highlight standout performances. However, this was often a challenge—I was balancing this role alongside a management job, with most days starting at 4am and finishing after 7pm, with just enough time to eat in between jobs.

After a couple of months, I experienced burnout for the first time. It was a difficult period, and I had to take a step back and reassess how I was managing my time and energy. But it became a turning point. I became more proactive in setting boundaries, prioritising tasks, and finding smarter ways to work under pressure.

In hindsight, I wish I’d had more time to build dashboards consistently—but the fast-paced, ever-changing nature of training sessions made it difficult to produce meaningful, comparable data every time. Still, the experience taught me a huge amount about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of sustainable working habits—lessons I now carry into every project I take on.

## Hydration

(maybe photo that i got of the pipettes and the reader)

jokey bit about it being every Saturday before the sun was up asking swimmers for their 
bottles of pee

say how it was important as it was easy to overlook, easily controllable, and makes a huge impact on performance
