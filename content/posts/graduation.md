**Having finally attended my graduation ceremony the other day, I've taken the chance to reflect on the years I spent at Nottingham Trent University...**
<!--more-->

## Reflection

It’s been a long journey — challenging, rewarding, and full of lessons I’m genuinely grateful for.

Graduating also brings with it the next challenge: finding a graduate-level role. In many ways, it feels like a second full-time job. The current market isn’t exactly inspiring either; only around half of graduates secure full-time work within 15 months of finishing their studies. Put simply, even after a year of searching, many people are still trying to get their foot in the door.

I’m fortunate to be earning a decent wage as a Department Manager, but it isn’t where I ultimately want to stay. I recently turned down the Deputy Store Manager position due to pay concerns, which pushed me to explore other opportunities more seriously. While reflecting on all this, I realised it might be worth sharing some of the tools and systems that helped me stay organised throughout university — and that continue to shape how I work today.

This post leans more “blog” than “portfolio”, but it still represents the way I think, the tools I rely on, and how I approach productivity and problem-solving.


## Doom Emacs

With work being full-on and the future feeling uncertain, I wanted to highlight a tool that genuinely helped me stay on top of everything: **Doom Emacs**.

I won't go into a full technical breakdown (there are entire wikis for that), but Doom Emacs is essentially a highly customisable, keyboard-driven productivity environment. The best way to explain it would be that it is similar to Obsidian, but so good that it makes Obsidian look poor (and people rave about how good Obsidian is).

For me, it became the perfect system for:

- Scheduling and planning
- Managing a to-do list
- Keeping clean, structured, reliable notes
- Staying focused during lectures and revision

What surprised me most wasn’t just how useful it was, but how it changed the way I approached work. Org-mode forced me to break tasks down, think in outlines, and structure ideas before diving in. Over time, that way of thinking bled into everything else — planning my dissertation, organising revision, even managing responsibilities at work.

Most days started the same way: open my agenda, review deadlines, capture anything new, and get on with it. During lectures, everything went into structured headings so revision later was painless. When dissertation season hit, having every source, idea, and draft section in one place kept me sane.

I still use Doom Emacs to this day (this post was written in it), and I can’t see myself switching anytime soon.

### Here's today's *TO DO* list for example.

## Syncthing

After losing handwritten notes in the first year and then dealing with OneNote drive issues (classic Microsoft moment), I needed something reliable and completely independent of cloud services.

Enter **Syncthing**.

Syncthing allowed me to link my laptop with my old desktop PC, which has plenty of storage. Any file I saved or updated on one device would instantly sync to the other. No subscriptions, no cloud outages, no "file not found" disaster.

This setup meant I always had:

- Automatic backups
- Local control over my data
- A seamless workflow between devices
- Peace of mind - especially when working on a 10,000-word dissertation

It's one of those tools that quietly does its job in the background, but makes a massive difference to day-to-day productivity.

## The Day Job

{{< figure src="/my-website/images/shop-front.png" link="/my-website/images/shop-front.png" >}}

Alongside the job search, I’m still working full-time as the Cycle Department Manager at Halfords. It’s a small store, which I actually prefer — it feels more like a local bike shop than a big chain. I see the same customers regularly, and there’s a level of trust and respect that comes from doing consistent, reliable work.

With our main bike technician returning in the new year, I’ve been handling the technical side myself: repairs, diagnostics, and giving customers clear, honest advice. On top of that, I’ve been sorting through issues that have been sitting untouched for years — 'quarantine' bikes, old repair jobs, stock that needs writing off or recovering, and all the admin that comes with it.

It’s not glamorous work, but it’s satisfying. There’s something rewarding about bringing order to a department that’s been neglected for so long.

The role also involves the usual management responsibilities: booking work in, resolving complaints, keeping the department running smoothly, and tracking targets. It’s a lot to juggle, but the systems I built during university — especially the way I use Emacs and org-mode — have made it far easier to stay organised and keep everything moving.

## Looking Ahead

As I move into the next chapter, searching for a graduate role that aligns with my skills, interests, and long-term goals, I’m reminded how much these systems shaped the way I work. Tools like Doom Emacs and Syncthing weren’t just conveniences during my degree; they became part of the way I think, plan, and solve problems. They helped me stay organised when things were hectic, and they continue to influence my workflow today — both in my personal projects and in my day-to-day responsibilities at work.

The more I reflect on it, the more I realise that what I enjoy most is building systems — whether that’s a workflow in Emacs, a synced file setup, or a process that makes a team run smoother. I’m looking for a role where that mindset actually matters: something analytical, structured, and grounded in problem-solving.

Until then, I’ll keep refining the tools I use and documenting what I learn here. This site is becoming part portfolio, part personal log — and I’m completely fine with that. If anything, it feels more honest.

And if you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. There’s plenty more on the way.
